# 🚀 Eleven Days of JavaScript

Welcome to my **Eleven Days of JavaScript** learning journey!  
In this phase, I focused on mastering **asynchronous JavaScript** and advanced concepts that are essential for building real-world web applications.

## 📘 Topics Covered

### 📍 1. Callback Hell
- Nested callbacks used for sequential asynchronous operations.
- Problems faced due to readability and maintainability.
- Example: setTimeout chains.

### 📍 2. Promises
- Cleaner way to handle asynchronous code.
- States: Pending, Resolved, Rejected.
- Methods: `.then()`, `.catch()`, `.finally()`.
- Chaining multiple promises to avoid callback hell.

### 📍 3. Async / Await
- Introduced in ES8 for writing asynchronous code in a synchronous way.
- Makes code cleaner and more readable.
- Used `try...catch` for error handling.

### 📍 4. IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
- Function that runs immediately after it's defined.
- Used for creating private scopes.
- Syntax:
  ```js
  (function () {
      console.log("This is an IIFE!");
  })();


🛠️Tools Used
  >JavaScript(ES6+)
  >VS Code

  🎯What I Learned
  . How to avoid callback hell using Promises and Async-await.
  .Clean coding practices for handling asynchronous operations.
  .The power of IIFE for creating isolated scopes.
  .Real world use cases of async opeartions in frontend/Backend.
